# 🎄 Advent of Code 2024 🎄

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2024** repository! This is where I will be uploading my solutions for the coding challenges published daily throughout December. Each day, I'll be tackling two puzzles, each more difficult than the last, all while improving my algorithmic and coding skills.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by each day's challenge. Inside each day’s folder, you will find:


📂 AdventOfCode2024
├── 📁 day01
│   ├── main.go
│   └── input.txt
├── 📁 day02
│   ├── main.go
│   └── input.txt
...

Each folder typically contains:

    Code: Solution for the day, implemented in Go, Python, or other languages.
    Input File: The input data for the day's puzzle.

## Technologies Used

- **Go**: The primary language I’ll be using for most of the challenges.
- **Other Languages**: Depending on the complexity of the challenge, I might use additional languages such as JavaScript or TypeScript.
